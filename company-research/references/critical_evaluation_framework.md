# Critical Evaluation Framework for Company Research

This reference provides guidelines for critically evaluating sources during company and people research. Apply these frameworks when analyzing information to identify biases, inconsistencies, and underlying truths.

## Source Credibility Spectrum

### High Objectivity Sources
These sources tend to provide factual, verifiable information with minimal bias:

1. **Financial/Regulatory Filings**
   - SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, S-1, proxy statements)
   - Annual reports (financial sections)
   - Earnings transcripts (financial data, not commentary)
   - **Why objective**: Legal requirements, audited, penalties for misstatement
   - **Watch for**: Forward-looking statements (less reliable)

2. **Technical Documentation**
   - API documentation
   - Product specifications
   - Patent filings
   - Technical whitepapers
   - **Why objective**: Functional requirements, verifiable
   - **Watch for**: Marketing language mixed in

3. **Third-Party Analysis**
   - Industry analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester)
   - Academic research papers
   - Independent audit reports
   - **Why objective**: Professional standards, peer review
   - **Watch for**: Potential conflicts of interest, sponsorships

4. **Government/Public Records**
   - Business registrations
   - Court filings and legal documents
   - Government contracts
   - Regulatory approvals/rejections
   - **Why objective**: Official records, public accountability
   - **Watch for**: Delays in updates, incomplete information

5. **Customer Usage Data**
   - GitHub stars/forks/contributors (for open source)
   - App store ratings and download counts
   - Website traffic rankings (Alexa, SimilarWeb)
   - **Why objective**: Real user behavior
   - **Watch for**: Potential for manipulation, selection bias

### Medium Objectivity Sources
These sources contain valuable information but require critical interpretation:

1. **News Articles**
   - Financial news (Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ)
   - Industry publications
   - Technology news sites
   - **Considerations**: Editorial standards, journalist expertise, timeliness
   - **Watch for**: Sensationalism, incomplete context, unnamed sources
   - **Evaluate**: Cross-reference across multiple outlets

2. **Product Reviews**
   - Professional reviews (TechCrunch, The Verge)
   - User reviews (G2, Capterra, Trustpilot)
   - Customer case studies (if independently verified)
   - **Considerations**: Reviewer incentives, sample size
   - **Watch for**: Sponsored content, selection bias, review manipulation
   - **Evaluate**: Patterns across many reviews vs. individual opinions

3. **Industry Conference Presentations**
   - Technical talks with demos
   - Research presentations
   - Panel discussions
   - **Considerations**: Peer validation, Q&A sessions
   - **Watch for**: Marketing disguised as education
   - **Evaluate**: Substance vs. promotion ratio

4. **Social Media (Professional)**
   - LinkedIn posts (from employees/executives)
   - Twitter/X threads (from credible industry voices)
   - GitHub discussions (for technical products)
   - **Considerations**: Authenticity, first-hand experience
   - **Watch for**: Personal opinions, limited context, employer loyalty
   - **Evaluate**: Track record of poster, corroboration

### Low Objectivity Sources
These sources are primarily promotional but still contain useful information:

1. **Company-Controlled Content**
   - Company website
   - Marketing materials
   - Press releases
   - Company blog posts
   - **Purpose**: Brand building, customer acquisition
   - **Watch for**: Exaggerations, selective facts, omitted weaknesses
   - **Extract**: Stated positioning, product features, company claims (to verify elsewhere)

2. **Company Leadership Communications**
   - CEO/founder interviews
   - Keynote speeches
   - Podcast appearances
   - LinkedIn posts from executives
   - **Purpose**: Vision casting, employee morale, investor relations
   - **Watch for**: Aspirational vs. actual, selective storytelling
   - **Extract**: Strategic direction, company culture, leadership style

3. **Sales/Marketing Materials**
   - Product demos
   - Sales decks
   - Case studies (company-published)
   - Webinars
   - **Purpose**: Lead generation, conversion
   - **Watch for**: Best-case scenarios, cherry-picked metrics
   - **Extract**: Product capabilities, target market, competitive positioning

4. **Sponsored Content**
   - Native advertising
   - Influencer posts
   - Affiliate reviews
   - **Purpose**: Paid promotion
   - **Watch for**: Disclosure (or lack thereof), conflicts of interest
   - **Extract**: Product features (verify independently)

## Critical Thinking Questions

### For Company Information

**Financial Health:**
- Are financial claims backed by verifiable filings?
- Do growth metrics align with independent traffic/usage data?
- Are customer numbers, revenue, or funding amounts corroborated by multiple sources?
- What's the gap between stated and actual financial performance?

**Product Claims:**
- Can stated features be verified through documentation or demos?
- Do customer reviews align with marketing claims?
- Are performance benchmarks independently tested?
- What's missing from the product description?

**Market Position:**
- How do competitor assessments align with independent analysis?
- Are market share claims backed by third-party research?
- Do customer reviews mention competitors? What do they say?
- What's the gap between claimed and actual market position?

**Funding Details:**
- What is the valuation at each funding round? Any down rounds or flat rounds?
- Who led each funding round? Who were the participating investors?
- Are funding amounts and valuations consistent across multiple sources (Crunchbase, press releases, news articles)?
- What's the valuation trajectory? Is it growing healthily or stagnating?

**Customer Signal Quality:**
- Which customers are Fortune 500 or Global 2000 companies? (Verify via public lists)
- Which customers are unicorns (valued at $1B+) or recently IPO'd (last 5 years)?
- Which customers are high-growth tech companies or publicly recognizable brands?
- Can customer relationships be verified via case studies, testimonials, or customer websites?
- Are customer claims consistent across sources or only appearing in marketing materials?

**Company Culture:**
- Do employee reviews (Glassdoor, Blind) align with stated culture?
- What do former employees say (LinkedIn, podcasts)?
- Are there patterns in employee tenure (LinkedIn)?
- What's the gap between stated and experienced culture?

### For People Information

**Professional Background:**
- Are job titles and dates consistent across LinkedIn, company bios, and news articles?
- Can stated accomplishments be verified through third-party sources?
- Are there unexplained gaps in employment history?
- How do self-descriptions compare to external descriptions?

**Reputation & Credibility:**
- What do former colleagues and employees say?
- Are there patterns in team turnover under their leadership?
- What's the trajectory of companies they've led (before, during, after)?
- How do they handle criticism or controversy?

**Thought Leadership:**

- Are technical claims backed by demonstrated expertise?
- How do industry peers regard them?
- What's the substance-to-self-promotion ratio?

## Identifying Inconsistencies

### Red Flags to Watch For

1. **Numerical Inconsistencies**
   - Different funding amounts across sources
   - Varying employee counts or customer numbers
   - Conflicting timelines for key events
   - **Action**: Note all versions, indicate which sources are most reliable

2. **Narrative Inconsistencies**
   - Company origin story varies across tellings
   - Product evolution timeline doesn't match
   - Leadership changes described differently
   - **Action**: Present multiple versions, note discrepancies

3. **Omission Patterns**
   - Positive sources ignore known problems
   - Company materials omit competitor advantages
   - Leadership bios skip employment periods
   - **Action**: Explicitly note what's missing from each source

4. **Tone Shifts**
   - Sudden changes in company messaging
   - Pivot in strategic direction without explanation
   - Abrupt changes in leadership communication style
   - **Action**: Investigate what triggered the shift

### How to Present Inconsistencies

For each significant inconsistency:
1. **State the inconsistency clearly**: "Source A claims X, while Source B states Y"
2. **Assess source reliability**: "Source A is a company press release (low objectivity), while Source B is an SEC filing (high objectivity)"
3. **Provide likely explanation**: "The discrepancy likely stems from..."
4. **Indicate confidence**: "Based on source reliability, Y is more likely accurate"
