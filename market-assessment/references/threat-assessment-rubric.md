# Threat Assessment Rubric

Use this rubric to systematically assess the competitive threat level of each competitor. Evaluate across multiple dimensions, then determine an overall threat level (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW).

---

## Assessment Framework

### Step 1: Score Each Dimension (0-10 scale)
Evaluate the competitor on each dimension below using a 0-10 scale:
- **0-3:** Low concern
- **4-6:** Moderate concern
- **7-10:** High concern

### Step 2: Calculate Weighted Score
Apply dimension weights to calculate overall threat score:
- **Total Score 0-30:** LOW threat
- **Total Score 31-60:** MEDIUM threat
- **Total Score 61-100:** HIGH threat

### Step 3: Apply Qualitative Adjustment
Consider qualitative factors that might raise or lower the threat level beyond the numeric score.

## Threat Assessment Dimensions

### 1. Product Similarity (Weight: 20%)

**Score (0-10):** [_____]

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **9-10:** Nearly identical product solving the same problem for same users with same approach
