# Competitive Matrix Template

Use this template to build a comprehensive comparison of the target company against identified competitors. The matrix should highlight points of differentiation vs commoditized features.

---

## Matrix Construction Guidelines

### Selection Criteria
- **Target Company:** Always include as first column
- **Key Competitors:** Include 5-10 most relevant competitors (prioritize high/medium threat)
- **Dimensions:** Select 10-15 most relevant comparison dimensions from categories below

### Differentiation Analysis
After completing the matrix, identify:
- **Points of Differentiation (POD):** Dimensions where companies differ significantly
- **Points of Parity (POP):** Dimensions where companies are similar (commoditized)
- **Unique Advantages:** Features/aspects only one company has

**Dimensions where target company is meaningfully different from competitors:**

1. **[Dimension Name]**
   - Target Company: [Description]
   - Competitors: [Description]
   - **Advantage/Disadvantage:** [Who wins on this dimension?]
   - **Strategic Importance:** [How critical is this difference?]

2. **[Dimension Name]**
   - Target Company: [Description]
   - Competitors: [Description]
   - **Advantage/Disadvantage:** [Who wins on this dimension?]
   - **Strategic Importance:** [How critical is this difference?]

[Add more as needed]

### Points of Parity (POP)

**Dimensions where companies are largely similar (commoditized features):**

1. **[Dimension Name]:** [Brief description of similarity]
2. **[Dimension Name]:** [Brief description of similarity]
3. **[Dimension Name]:** [Brief description of similarity]

[Add more as needed]

### Unique Advantages

## Competitive Positioning Map

**Instructions:** Create a 2x2 positioning map using two key dimensions that matter most to customers.

### Suggested Dimension Pairs:
- **X-axis:** Price (Low → High) | **Y-axis:** Features (Basic → Advanced)
- **X-axis:** Technical Complexity (Simple → Complex) | **Y-axis:** Performance (Low → High)
- **X-axis:** Self-serve (Easy) → Enterprise (Complex) | **Y-axis:** Price (Low → High)

### Positioning Map:

```
                 [Y-axis: High]
                      ↑
                      |
         [Competitor] | [Target]
                      |
    ←─────────────────┼─────────────────→
         [Competitor] | [Competitor]
                      |
                      ↓
                 [Y-axis: Low]
         [X-axis: Low]   [X-axis: High]
```

**Insights from positioning:**
- [Insight 1: Where is the target company positioned?]
- [Insight 2: Is there whitespace in the market?]
- [Insight 3: Where is competition most intense?]
