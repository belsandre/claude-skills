## Verification Framework

### Verification Status Taxonomy

| Symbol | Status | Definition |
|--------|--------|------------|
| ✅ | **Verified** | Strong evidence confirms the claim (GitHub metrics, third-party validation, verifiable data) |
| ✓ | **Likely True** | Circumstantial evidence supports the claim (credible sources, logical consistency) |
| ⚠️ | **Unverified** | Claim made but no evidence found to confirm or contradict |
| ❌ | **Contradicted** | Evidence suggests the claim is false or significantly misleading |
| 🔍 | **Needs Investigation** | Claim requires deeper research to verify |

### Evidence Hierarchy (Strongest → Weakest)

1. **Verifiable Metrics** (✅)
   - GitHub stars, commits, contributors (public)
   - Open-source code (can inspect)
   - Public financial filings (for public companies)

   - Academic papers and peer review
   - Court/legal documents

2. **Third-Party Validation** (✅ or ✓)
   - Independent reviews and analysis
   - Customer testimonials (verified customers)
   - Industry analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester)

### Step 4: Research Each Claim

For each priority claim:
1. Identify what evidence would verify it
2. Search for that evidence systematically
3. Document findings
4. Assign verification status
5. Note confidence level

### Step 5: Document Results

## Common Verification Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Confirmation Bias:** Looking only for evidence that supports claims, not contradicting evidence
2. **Trust Without Verification:** Accepting company claims at face value
3. **Outdated Information:** Using old data to verify current claims
4. **Correlation ≠ Causation:** Mistaking correlations for proof of claims
5. **Cherry-Picked Evidence:** Finding one piece of supporting evidence and stopping
6. **Scope Limitation Errors:** Missing that claims are technically true but misleadingly narrow
7. **Authority Bias:** Overweighting claims because of who makes them
8. **Anchoring:** Being influenced by initial positive/negative impressions
